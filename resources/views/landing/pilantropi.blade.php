            <h3>Travis Scott is not just an ordinary rapper, he is also a very generous person. Travis Scott has launched a series of multi-level, long-term, community-focused philanthropic and investment efforts called Project HEAL through his Cactus Jack Foundation. Did Travis donate any money? Yes. Travis Scott is donating $5 million to community-based projects through a new initiative.

        <h3>/pro.ject/ - /he.al/</h3>
        <p>Project HEAL's vision is to create a world where everyone with an eating disorder has the opportunities & resources they need to heal. Project HEAL exists as a resource for all people struggling with disordered eating in the United States. We believe that equity is a restorative process, not an event. In contrast to equality, equity is aimed at a just distribution of resources that acknowledges inherent inequity in our existing systems. Equity is not a punitive process, nor an inversion of the existing hierarchy. In order to create a world where everyone can experience the eating disorder healing they deserve - regardless of age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, size, health, ability, or financial means - we strive to ensure that Project HEAL’s limited resources are leveraged to create the most meaningful impact for those the system is most egregiously failing. We use an intuitive, individualized, case-by-case approach, and intentionally prioritize those who have been excluded from or harmed by the eating disorder field due to biases like racism, weight discrimination, transphobia, homophobia, ableism, healthism, and classism. We believe that healing from an eating disorder is possible with access to resources and opportunities. Project HEAL has intentionally chosen to use the word “healing” rather than “recovery” because recovery implies a regaining of something that was lost. We believe that both the eating disorder experience and the healing process fundamentally change a person as well as the communities to which they belong, so instead of aspiring to return to a former “normal,” we encourage an embrace of the tools and growth that eating disorder healing offers. </p>
